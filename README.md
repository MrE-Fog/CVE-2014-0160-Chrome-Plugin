Heartbleed chrome plugin *DEPRECATED*
=========

![2016-02-16_16-52-07](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8536299/13081643/e628cd12-d4cd-11e5-9175-a5a51dadd7c8.jpg)

Chrome plugin who will look-up if the current site (and all subdomains called) are vulnerable to CVE-2014-0160.<br />
The vulnerability check is done by an API service who's now dead (it wasn't in 2014!)<br />
May the code can be useful to someone anyway, if someone found a new API provider for heartbleed check.<br />
